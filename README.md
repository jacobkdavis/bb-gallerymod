# bb-gallery-mod

WordPress plugin to add a customized Gallery Mod(ified) card to the Beaver Builder modules.  

The new Gallery Mod module includes a standard column layout without being limited to thumbnail image sizes, and it also includes some usual customizations and improvements we found ourselves making over time.

After activating, the "Gallery Mod" module will be available under the "Media" module category.
